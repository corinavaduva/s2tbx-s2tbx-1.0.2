<h3>Import NetCDF/CF</h3>

<p>The NetCDF/CF reader enables the Sentinel-2 Toolbox to import generic NetCDF/CF data products.</p>

<p>The NetCDF/CF reader supports any image-like NetCDF/CF file structure up to
    NetCDF version 3.5. The currently used NetCDF Java library version is 4.3.22.</p>

<p class="inote"><b>Note: </b> You can find additional information about NetCDF at
    <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/</a> and
    about the NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention
    at <a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/">http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/</a>.
</p>

<p>Additionally the NetCDF library also handles reading of HDF4 and HDF5 files. Currently it supports reading of
    HDF-EOS products in gridded format using the Lat/Lon projection and the sinusoidal projection.
    These are e.g the MODIS L3 products.
